This app will deal with books

A book management website is a platform that helps individuals organize and keep track of their book collection. It provides tools to catalog books, search through the collection, and manage information such as author, title, ISBN, and publication date. The website helps users manage their books, keep them organized, and access information about their collection quickly and easily.
